# PetVet

### `Introduction`

That is my very first project i made all by myself. It's pretty simple, created mainly with use of HTML and CSS and a very little file of pure JavaScript. `THIS WEBSTIE
IS NOT MOBILE FIRENDLY`, but you can get the idea of how it's supposed to look on mobile by resizing the deskopt browser window. I guess my CSS wasn't that good at the
time :see_no_evil:

### `General info`

This project was made for educational purposes. The idea behind id was to create a website for a made up veterinary clinic. 


### `Reflection`
