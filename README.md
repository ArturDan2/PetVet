### `Introduction`

That is my very first project i made all by myself. It's pretty simple, created mainly with use of HTML and CSS and a very little file of pure JavaScript.

### `General info`

This project was made for educational purposes. The idea behind id was to create a website for a made up veterinary clinic. All of the extra features like log in/sign in buttons and even some pages are a dummies made only for styling purposes.
